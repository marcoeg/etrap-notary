# ETRAP NEAR Smart Contract

A NEAR Protocol smart contract for the Enterprise Transaction Receipt Anchoring Platform (ETRAP). This contract manages NFTs that represent batches of database transactions, providing blockchain-based proof of integrity.

## Features

- **NFT-based batch certificates**: Each NFT represents a batch of database transactions
- **Merkle tree verification**: Verify individual transactions belong to a batch
- **Efficient indexing**: Multiple indices for fast searches by database, time, table
- **Per-organization deployment**: Each organization gets their own contract instance
- **Minimal on-chain storage**: Detailed data stored in S3, only merkle roots on-chain

## Contract Overview

### 1. NFT Standard Compliance
- Fully implements **NEP-177** (NEAR's NFT standard).
- Each NFT represents a batch of database transactions.
- Includes standard NFT **transfer**, **enumeration**, and **metadata** functionality.

### 2. Per-Organization Design
- Contract is initialized with organization-specific metadata.
- Custom **name** and **symbol** for each organization.
- **Isolated data storage** per organization.

### 3. Batch Processing Architecture
- Each NFT contains a **Merkle root** for verification.
- **Minimal on-chain storage** (only essential data).
- References to **S3** for detailed transaction data.
- **Batch summaries** with operation counts and metadata.

### 4. Efficient Search Indices
- **By Database**: Quick lookup of all batches for a specific database.
- **By Month**: Time-based grouping for historical queries.
- **By Timestamp**: TreeMap for efficient range queries.
- **By Table**: Find batches affecting specific tables.
- **Recent Cache**: Last 100 batches for quick access.

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (1.72.0)
- [NEAR CLI](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-cli) 
- Node.js 18+ (for NEAR CLI)
- A NEAR testnet account

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and install dependencies**:
```bash
git clone <repository>
cd notary
cargo fetch
```

2. **Build the contract**:
```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

3. **Deploy to testnet**:
```bash
# Set up environment
export NEAR_ENV=testnet

# Deploy (replace with your account)
near deploy yourorg.testnet out/etrap_contract.wasm

# Initialize
near call yourorg.testnet new '{
  "organization_id": "yourorg.testnet",
  "organization_name": "Your Organization",
  "etrap_treasury": "etrap-treasury.testnet",
  "etrap_fee_amount": 0.05
}' --accountId yourorg.testnet
```

## Scripts and Tools

### Build Script

**`build.sh`** - Builds the NEAR smart contract

```bash
./build.sh
```

Features:
- Automatically adds the wasm target
- Optimizes build with proper flags
- Creates output directory and copies wasm file
- Shows contract size
- Optional wasm-opt optimization if available

### Deployment Script

**`etrap_deploy.sh`** - Comprehensive deployment and testing commands

This script contains complete examples for:
- Contract deployment and initialization
- Minting sample NFT batches with realistic data
- Querying and searching batches
- Transaction verification examples
- Admin functions

**Usage:**
```bash
# View all commands (don't execute directly - it's a reference script)
cat etrap_deploy.sh

# Extract specific sections for your use
```

### Testing Scripts

Located in `scripts/` directory:

**`check_gas_usage.sh`** - Monitor gas costs for transactions
```bash
# Check typical gas costs
./scripts/check_gas_usage.sh

# Check specific transaction
./scripts/check_gas_usage.sh [TRANSACTION_ID]
```

**`check_settings.sh`** - View contract settings
```bash
./scripts/check_settings.sh
```

**`test_fee_calculation.sh`** - Information about fee calculation behavior
```bash
./scripts/test_fee_calculation.sh
```

**`test_sha256.sh`** - Test SHA256 merkle root verification
```bash
./scripts/test_sha256.sh
```

## Contract Methods

### Write Methods (require gas)

- `mint_batch` - Create a new NFT for a transaction batch
- `set_paused` - Pause/unpause contract (owner only)
- `update_treasury` - Update fee collection address (owner only)

### View Methods (free)

- `get_recent_batches` - Get most recent batches
- `get_batches_by_database` - Search by database name
- `get_batches_by_time_range` - Search by timestamp range
- `get_batches_by_table` - Search by table name
- `get_batch_stats` - Get statistics

### Verification
- `verify_document_in_batch` - Verify transaction with merkle proof


### 6. Data Structures
The contract uses optimized data structures matching the design specifications:
- **Batch summaries** stored on-chain with Merkle roots.
- **S3 references** for detailed data.
- **Operation counts** and **metadata** for analytics.

### 7. Admin Controls
- **Pausable contract** for emergency situations.
- **Treasury address management** for fee collection.
- **Settings** stored in lazy option for efficiency.

### 8. Event System
Emits structured events for off-chain indexers containing:
- Batch metadata.
- S3 location references.
- Database and table information.
- Merkle roots for verification.

## Quick Examples

### Basic Contract Interaction

```bash
# Build the contract
./build.sh

# Deploy to testnet
near deploy myorg.testnet out/etrap_contract.wasm

# Initialize
near call myorg.testnet new '{
  "organization_id": "myorg.testnet",
  "organization_name": "My Organization",
  "etrap_treasury": "etrap-treasury.testnet",
  "etrap_fee_amount": 0.01
}' --accountId myorg.testnet

# Check recent batches
near view myorg.testnet get_recent_batches '{"limit": 5}'

# Check contract settings
near view myorg.testnet get_settings '{}'
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Make changes to src/lib.rs
# 2. Build and test
./build.sh
cargo test

# 3. Deploy updated contract
near deploy myorg.testnet out/etrap_contract.wasm

# 4. Test with sample data (see etrap_deploy.sh for examples)
near call myorg.testnet mint_batch '{...}' --accountId myorg.testnet --deposit 0.1
```

## Key Design Decisions
- **Storage Optimization**: Uses NEAR's efficient storage patterns with proper key prefixing.
- **Gas Efficiency**: View methods are free; only minting requires gas.
- **Scalability**: Indices allow efficient queries even with millions of NFTs.
- **Security**: Private admin functions, validation checks, pausable design.
